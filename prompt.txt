Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model.A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform. A prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query such as "what is Fermat's little theorem?",a command such as "write a poem about leaves falling",or a longer statement including context, instructions,and conversation history. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style,providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as "Act as a native French speaker".A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as asking the model to complete "maison → house, chat → cat, chien →" (the expected response being dog),an approach called few-shot learning.
