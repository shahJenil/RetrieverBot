In fluid dynamics, a stall is a reduction in the lift coefficient generated by a foil as angle of attack exceeds its critical value.The critical angle of attack is typically about 15°, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil – including its shape, size, and finish – and Reynolds number.Stalls in fixed-wing aircraft are often experienced as a sudden reduction in lift. It may be caused either by the pilot increasing the wing's angle of attack or by a decrease in the critical angle of attack. The latter may be due to slowing down (below stall speed) or the accretion of ice on the wings (especially if the ice is rough). A stall does not mean that the engine(s) have stopped working, or that the aircraft has stopped moving—the effect is the same even in an unpowered glider aircraft. Vectored thrust in aircraft is used to maintain altitude or controlled flight with wings stalled by replacing lost wing lift with engine or propeller thrust, thereby giving rise to post-stall technology.
